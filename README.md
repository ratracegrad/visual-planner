# Visual Planner

This project was created to demonstrate the ability to add drag and drop in a Vue application. 

We will have a list of machines at our plants. Each machine will have a schedule of jobs that will be run that day. Plant Managers can drag and drop to change the start time for any job.

## Screenshots

Here is a screenshot of the application running:
